      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>The overall experience building this website was an enjoyable one.Developing the toolbar using the pure framework was really interesting. Key factors we had to take into consideration were , layout design, button placement among other UI/UX elemnts. </p>
      <h3>Expectation</h3>
      <p>Our expectation for the PURE framework was minimal. However the framework is highly customizable ,easy to use, provides a clear visual experience for the end user. The PURE framework is very similar to Boostrap so finding that familiarity in such a compact and small framework without the unnecesarry clutter is refreshing.</p>
      <h3>Install Review</h3>
      <p>Most of developers refer back that the PURE framework is easily instalable through the free unpkg CDN methods which generally consists of copying a few lines into the header file of your html doc. </p>
      <h3>Learning curve</h3>
      <p>Since the PURE framework is mainly CSS based as well as its similarity to bootstap the learning curve was not very steep. Basic CSS is very widely used among web developers so PURE css is merely an extension of regular CSS. Due to our experience throught this course and outside school. we found it very easy to integrate this framework.</p>
      <h3>Overall</h3>
      <p>We all took equal share parts in this project, the overall ambience was well respected, very time organized.We found our chosen frameworks were very easy to implement and use thus we do not regret any part of it.</p>
